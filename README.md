# Student Management Program

## What I Built
This is a **Java program** to manage a list of students. It allows the user to **add**, **remove**, and **display** student records. Each student has an **ID**, **name**, and **grade**.

## Why I Built It
The program was created to practice **object-oriented programming**, **ArrayLists**, and **basic user interaction** in Java. It demonstrates how to manage dynamic data, handle user input, and perform operations on collections.

## How I Built It
- Created a `Student` class with fields `id`, `name`, and `grade`.  
- Implemented methods in `Main` class to:
  - `addStudent()` – Add a new student to the list.  
  - `removeStudent()` – Remove a student by their ID.  
  - `displayStudents()` – Display all students.  
- Used an **ArrayList** to store student objects dynamically.  
- Used a `while` loop and `switch` statement to create a **menu-driven interface** for user actions.
